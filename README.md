# Simple-Class-Absences
Simple Class Absences that uses XAMPP (in MySQL and MyPHPAdmin)


At first, this project was just for a school assignment, but I know that this project will be very useful 😎.
Tested in XAMPP v3.3.0 and only uses Indonesian as the language.


How to use:
1. Download the file in Releases page https://github.com/japhizzz/Simple-Class-Absences/releases/tag/Release
2. Extract it and place the "absensi" folder in XAMPP\htdocs folder (default path in Windows: C:\XAMPP\htdocs).
3. Open XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL service.
4. For the first time, run http://localhost/absensi/setup.php in your web browser.
5. Use the default login in "Setup" page to login, and click "Masuk ke Sistem Absensi".
6. Login to the user you want.


You can edit this file whatever you want, because it's open source 😎✌️.
